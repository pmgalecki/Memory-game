# Zwierzobranie memory game

Final project and a conclusion of front-end developer course I did with Coders Trust Polska. My goal was to program a memory/concentration type game for a client of my selection. I took Wroc≈Çawskie Zoo and gave my game animals theme. The script was written in plain JavaScript. I used SASS/SCSS for styles. I also made some sounds to give the game more gameplay. Images of animals are roalty-free pictures found at https://www.shutterstock.com/ .
